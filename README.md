# CORE
This repository contains the source code of the Collaborative Oriented Relation Extraction (CORE) system for building Knowledge Bases (KBs) with limited manual annotations. CORE is based on the combination of distant supervision and active learning paradigms, and features a seamless, transparent, modular architecture suited to large-scale processing. 

## Code

### Data Processing

### Knowledge Base Construction

The source code to build the CORE system can be found in ```./src```

## Knowledge Base

## SPARQL End-Point

The Gene Expression-Cancer KB generated by the CORE system is available at: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7577127.

The SPARQL end-point to query the KB is available at: http://w3id.org/corekb/sparql.

This work has been submitted to KDD 2023 and is currently under review.
