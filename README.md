# CORE
This repository contains the source code of the Collaborative Oriented Relation Extraction (CORE) system for building Knowledge Bases (KBs) with limited manual annotations. CORE is based on the combination of distant supervision and active learning paradigms, and features a seamless, transparent, modular architecture suited to large-scale processing. 

## Code

### Source Code

The source code to build the CORE system can be found in ```./src```.
The code divides into:
- ```./src/core```: contains the code required to build the KB
- ```./src/data```: contains the code required to process data
- ```./src/models```: contains the code required to make RE models

### Data Processing

The scripts used to process data divide into:
- ```retrieve_pubmed_data.py``` and ```crawl_citing_papers.py``` which gather PubMed data
- ```process_disgenet_data.py``` and ```process_pubtator_data.py``` which process DisGeNET and PubTator data
- ```prepare_data.py``` which prepare data for KB construction

### Relation Extraction

### Knowledge Base Construction


## Knowledge Base

## SPARQL End-Point

The Gene Expression-Cancer KB generated by the CORE system is available at: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7577127.

The SPARQL end-point to query the KB is available at: http://w3id.org/corekb/sparql.

This work has been submitted to KDD 2023 and is currently under review.

## Acks
The work is supported by the ExaMode project, as part of the EU H2020 program under Grant Agreement no. 825292.
The development of the CORE system benefited from the valuable contribution of the medical centres and clinicians involved in the ExaMode project. We would like to express our gratitude for their support and feedback, which has been instrumental in the creation of the CORE KB.
